# Otalu_PHP_MVC

This is an mvc design pattern based PHP framework. 
I am sincerely grateful to Curtis for the previlege of his course on MVC and Design Pattern. 
 
This repo is not just the framework but also contact management app built on top of this mini framework.
Perusing through the the app part will give anyone intending to use the framework a practical insight into the functions
at his disposal... When I have food I will extend the framework further and write a proper documentation.

The name: the name of the project is inspired by a River Deity in a town in Anambra State. The deity is know to have Python as its 
messenger.

NB: This framework came out of months of trying to understand the MVC design pattern using the PHP language,
as such it is currently not optimized to solve any particular problem.

2. API support resources
