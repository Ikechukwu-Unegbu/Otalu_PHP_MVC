# Otalu_PHP_MVC

This is an mvc design pattern based PHP framework I built during the period of my training following MVC design pattern course created by Curtis Parham.
I am sincerely grateful to Curtis for the previlege of his course. 

I am currently committed to extending it while I use it daily on my daily vanila PHP projects. 
This repo is not just the framework but also contact management app built on top of this mini framework.
Perusing through the the app part will give anyone intending to use the framework a practical insight into the functions
at his disposal...
