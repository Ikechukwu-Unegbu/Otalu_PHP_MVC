# Otalu_PHP_MVC

This is an mvc design pattern based PHP framework I built during the period of my training following MVC design pattern course created by Curtis Parham.
I am sincerely grateful to Curtis for the previlege of his course. 

I am currently committed to extending it while I use it daily on my daily vanila PHP projects. 
This repo is not just the framework but also contact management app built on top of this mini framework.
Perusing through the the app part will give anyone intending to use the framework a practical insight into the functions
at his disposal...

The name: the name of the project is inspired by a River Deity in a town in Anambra State. The deity is know to have Python as its 
messenger.

Coming extensions will include

1. Improved Router capable of navigating multiple sub directories 
2. Adding "LIKE" for search to the query builder methods
3. Multi table query builder
4. Composer Support
5. API resources
